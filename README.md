# Abstraction in Java

- Here I am building on a previous Java project which I titlyed Polymorphism Inheritance Overriding Object Type Casting
- In that previous project the getArea method was not created with the keyword abstract and was therefore just simply
- being overriden in all the child classes, now we can create an object of the super class "Shape" that has the getArea() method
